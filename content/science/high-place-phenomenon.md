You're standing on a balcony. Or at a cliff edge. Or on a bridge. And for a second — brief, unbidden — your mind goes to jumping.

You step back. You're fine. But you're a little unsettled by the thought.

You probably don't talk about it. It seems like the kind of thing you shouldn't say out loud. You wonder what it means about you.

It means you're in roughly half the human population.

## L'Appel du Vide

The French call it *l'appel du vide*: the call of the void. A passing impulse, near a high edge, toward the thing you would never do.

It sounds poetic. It is also extremely common and, once understood, is actually evidence of a healthy brain.

In 2012, psychologist Jennifer Hames and colleagues at Florida State University published a study asking college students whether they had ever experienced an urge to jump from a high place when they weren't suicidal. **About half reported it.** A 2018 replication with a larger sample got similar results. Among people with no history of suicidal ideation — completely healthy, no psychiatric concerns — around 50% said yes.

This is not a rare phenomenon. It's not a warning sign. It's something the brain does.

## What's Actually Happening

The best current explanation involves a **misattribution of a safety signal**.

When you stand near a high edge, your brain's threat detection systems activate immediately. Your survival circuitry — centered on the amygdala and related subcortical structures — is highly sensitive to height. You feel the pull of gravity. You register the distance to the ground. Your body tenses. You lean back.

Your brain also generates an explicit corrective thought: **don't go closer, step back, move away from the edge.** This thought is designed to override any forward movement.

Here's the problem. That corrective thought is so salient — so intense and prioritized — that it gets noticed consciously. And when the conscious mind notices an intense, sudden thought about a high place and jumping, it does what brains do with surprising signals: it tries to find an explanation.

The most available explanation: *part of you must want to jump.*

You don't. There's no part of you that wants to jump. What you noticed was the strength of your own survival response — the very thing preventing any jump. But the conscious mind misread the signal.

This misattribution pattern is consistent with research on **intrusive thoughts** generally. Thoughts that feel like they "come from nowhere" — violent thoughts, taboo thoughts, thoughts that seem to contradict your values — are not statements about hidden desires. They're noise that the threat-detection system generates, amplified precisely because they're threatening, and then conspicuously noticed by the very same threat-detection system that generated them.

The thought "I could jump" is your brain doing its job, loudly. You noticed because your brain meant for some version of that signal to be noticed.

## Why It Happens More to Some People

Hames and her colleagues found that people who reported higher anxiety and higher interoceptive sensitivity — greater awareness of their own bodily sensations — were more likely to experience the high place phenomenon.

This makes sense. If you're more attuned to your body's threat signals, you're more likely to consciously register the safety-signal-turned-intrusive-thought that causes the phenomenon. The experience isn't more common in people with anxiety because they're more at risk — it's more common because they're paying closer attention to signals that most people's conscious awareness filters out.

The researchers also found — counterintuitively — that people who reported the phenomenon were **less likely** to have suicidal ideation, not more. The corrective mechanism is functioning strongly. The void is calling loudly, and the brain is responding loudly.

## The Broader Pattern

High place phenomenon is a specific instance of a broader cognitive phenomenon: **intrusive thoughts**.

Everyone has intrusive thoughts. The clinical literature is clear on this — population studies consistently find that 90%+ of people report occasional intrusive thoughts about violence, accidents, contamination, taboo actions, or causing harm, with no intention to act on any of them. The content of intrusive thoughts tends to be whatever would be most terrible — which is partly why they're so memorable and distressing.

The Salkovskis model of obsessive thinking proposes that the problem isn't the occurrence of intrusive thoughts (universal) but the **interpretation** of them. People who interpret intrusive thoughts as meaningful — as evidence of hidden desires, as morally significant, as threatening signals about who they really are — are more likely to spiral into rumination and distress. People who recognize them as mental noise are not.

This is the cognitive foundation of treatments for OCD: **exposure and response prevention**, combined with learning to interpret intrusive thoughts as involuntary neural events rather than communications from the self.

The high place phenomenon is a particularly vivid example of this because the context is so clear — you're standing at a high edge, your threat system is visibly activated — and the thought is so easily misattributed.

## What It Tells You About Your Brain

The high place phenomenon is not a dark warning about your psychology. It's a demonstration of how active your survival systems are.

Your brain is constantly modeling danger. It generates "what could go wrong" scenarios as a matter of routine threat assessment — most of them never surface to conscious awareness. At a cliff edge, the threat is salient enough that the corrective response breaks through.

You noticed the thought. You stepped back. That's exactly what happened.

The void called. Your brain answered first.

If you've experienced this: you're not disturbed, you're not secretly suicidal, and you're not alone. You're among roughly half the humans who have stood near an edge and felt their survival system working loudly enough to hear.

The thought was your brain doing its job. It just did it conspicuously enough to confuse you.
