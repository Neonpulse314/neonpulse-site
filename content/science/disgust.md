title: "Why Do We Feel Disgust?"
summary: "Disgust evolved to protect you from disease — a fast, powerful system for avoiding pathogens and contaminated food. Then something happened: it got recruited for moral judgment. The same system that makes you gag at rotting meat now makes some people gag at political opponents. This is one of the stranger stories about how evolution repurposes hardware."

You find a hair in your food. You pick up the plate and set it aside. The food is otherwise identical to what you were eating before. You might not finish it.

This response — immediate, powerful, disproportionate to the actual harm from one hair — is the disgust system doing its job. And the job is older, simpler, and more consequential than it appears.

## The Original Function

Paul Rozin at the University of Pennsylvania, who has spent decades studying disgust, describes it as the "guardian of the body" — a system evolved to protect the body's borders from contamination.

The core disgust stimuli are almost universal: bodily products (feces, vomit, saliva, blood), decaying organic material, and animals or animal products that carry pathogen risk. These produce the characteristic disgust response: nausea, facial contraction (the nose wrinkle and upper lip curl), and avoidance.

This is not culturally constructed — it's a basic emotional system with consistent cross-cultural signatures. Psychologist Paul Ekman identified disgust as one of the six basic emotions with universal facial expression. The response is rooted in the same biology that produces olfactory sensitivity to certain compounds (H₂S, putrescine, cadaverine — all associated with decay) at extremely low concentrations.

The function: avoid consuming things that will make you sick. The system runs fast, emotional, and often overwrites reasoning — because in the ancestral environment, reasoning through whether to eat something that smelled like decay was a bad strategy. Disgust prevented that deliberation.

## The Contamination Effect

One of Rozin's key findings: disgust follows a logic of contagion rather than rational risk assessment.

In a famous demonstration: a sterilized, new, never-used comb is described as having previously touched cockroaches. Most people find the comb disgusting and don't want to use it, even though they know it's clean.

This "once in contact, always contaminated" logic extends to associations, not just actual contact. A t-shirt that used to belong to a person you find disgusting feels disgusting even washed. A glass that was previously used by someone you dislike may feel less appealing, even if sterilized.

The system is tracking symbolic contamination — the history of an object — not its actual pathogen status. This was probably adaptive: in a world without sterilization equipment, tracking which objects had contact with known contamination sources was a reasonable approximation of risk. But it produces irrational responses in modern contexts where sterilization is reliable.

## Moral Disgust

Here's where it gets strange.

Jonathan Haidt at NYU has documented extensively that disgust has been **recruited into moral judgment** — specifically, moral judgments about purity and degradation.

Experimental subjects shown disgusting stimuli before being asked to make moral judgments render harsher verdicts. Disgusting smells in a room increase moral condemnation. Hypnotic disgust induction (subjects post-hypnotically experience disgust at neutral words) causes harsher judgments about moral scenarios involving those words.

The "purity" dimension of moral judgment — which appears in moral systems focused on sexual defilement, bodily corruption, religious contamination, social defilement — appears to be running on the same emotional hardware as pathogen avoidance. The moral system borrowed disgust's power from the disease-avoidance system.

This creates a significant problem: **moral disgust is not rational**. The same cognitive shortcuts that make contamination judgment fast and unrevisable (once disgusting, always disgusting) apply to moral judgment when disgust is the underlying emotion. Moral positions grounded in disgust are peculiarly resistant to rational argument because they're not running on the rational system.

## Disgust Sensitivity and Politics

One of the more politically provocative findings in disgust research: individual differences in disgust sensitivity predict political orientation.

Yoel Inbar and David Pizarro found that people with higher disgust sensitivity (measured by standard scales asking how strongly they react to various disgusting stimuli) are more likely to hold conservative positions on social issues — particularly those involving sexual behavior, purity norms, and bodily matters.

The relationship is specific: disgust sensitivity predicts social conservatism but not economic conservatism. It's not about a general preference for hierarchy or order — it's about the specific purity-and-defilement dimension of moral judgment.

The interpretation: conservatives are not more disgusted by political opponents as a *result* of their conservatism — rather, individuals high in disgust sensitivity may be drawn to moral frameworks that emphasize purity and contamination, which are more prominent in conservative social ideology.

This doesn't make conservative positions wrong, or make liberal positions right. It points out that the emotional substrate of certain moral judgments is disgust, which is a fast, non-revisable system optimized for pathogen avoidance, not for evaluating complex social policy.

## Why You Can't Reason Yourself Out of Disgust

The most important feature of disgust for practical purposes: it's deeply resistant to rational revision.

You can explain to someone exactly why a sterilized object is clean. They will still find it somewhat disgusting. You can present compelling arguments for why a "disgusting" moral practice is harmless. The disgust remains.

This is a consequence of disgust's design: it evolved to prevent deliberation, not enable it. A fast, unrevisable, contamination-tracking system was more useful than a slow, reasoning-based one for the domain it was designed for.

When disgust is recruited into moral judgment, its resistance to revision travels with it. Moral positions grounded in disgust are experienced as obvious and self-evident — "it just feels wrong" — rather than as conclusions that require justification. They're hard to change because the emotional foundation doesn't respond to argument.

The hair in your food is long gone. The plate is clean.

You might not want to eat it anyway.

That's the system doing what it was built to do.

The question is whether it was built for this particular situation.
