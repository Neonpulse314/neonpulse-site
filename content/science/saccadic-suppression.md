title: "Why Can't You See Your Own Eyes Move in a Mirror?"
summary: "Try it. Stand in front of a mirror and look back and forth between your eyes. You'll never catch them moving. Everyone else can see your eyes move perfectly clearly — but you're blind to it. This is called saccadic suppression, and it says something strange about how the brain constructs reality."

Stand in front of a mirror. Look at your left eye, then your right eye. Now try to catch your eyes moving.

You can't.

From the outside, it's obvious. Someone standing next to you would see your eyes dart back and forth without any difficulty. Film yourself with a camera — the movement is clear. But from the inside, you see your left eye, then your right eye, with no transition between them. The movement is invisible to you.

This happens every time you move your eyes. All day, thousands of times. And you never see it.

## What's Actually Happening

Your eyes move in a particular way called **saccades** — rapid, jumping movements that shift your gaze from one point to another. A typical saccade takes between 20 and 200 milliseconds depending on the distance, and the eye can move at speeds up to 700 degrees per second during one. This is among the fastest movements the human body makes.

During a saccade, the visual image on your retina is smeared and blurred — the eye is moving too fast for the scene to be in focus. If the visual cortex processed this information normally, you would experience a nauseating streak every time you moved your eyes. You don't experience that. Instead, the world appears seamlessly stable.

This is because the brain actively suppresses visual processing during saccades. A few milliseconds before the eye begins to move, and continuing through the movement itself, the visual cortex reduces its sensitivity. The blurred, streaking signal from the retina is essentially discarded. When the eye arrives at its new position and the image stabilizes, visual processing resumes, and you experience the new scene as if you jumped there instantaneously.

This suppression is called **saccadic suppression** — or more technically, saccadic masking.

## The Timing Problem It Solves

Here's the deeper puzzle saccadic suppression is solving.

Your eyes are moving to a new location. When they arrive, the visual signal from the new location has to travel from the retina up through the visual processing hierarchy — a process that takes roughly 50-100 milliseconds. The brain wants to know what you're looking at *now*, but the only information available is what was there a tenth of a second ago.

To keep the subjective experience of vision seamlessly continuous, the brain does something remarkable: it uses the saccadic plan itself — the motor command it just sent to move the eyes — to predict what the new scene will look like, and temporarily fills in that expectation before the visual signal arrives.

This mechanism, called **predictive remapping**, means that the brain knows roughly where the eyes are going to land and pre-updates its spatial model of the world accordingly. When the actual visual signal arrives and matches the prediction, the transition feels smooth and instantaneous.

The brain is not passively recording what the eyes see. It is actively constructing a stable world out of a series of fragmented, blurred snapshots, filling the gaps with predictions, and suppressing the evidence of its own mechanics.

## Why You Can't See Your Eyes Move in the Mirror

The mirror case is the most striking demonstration of saccadic suppression because it feels like it should be different. Your eyes are right there. The movement should be obvious.

But the critical point is that saccadic suppression doesn't care what you're looking at. It operates on the motor command, not the content of vision. The moment your brain sends the command to move your eyes, the visual suppression begins — regardless of whether the thing you're about to look at is across the room or in the mirror two feet away.

By the time your eyes arrive at the new position and vision resumes, the movement is already over. You get left eye, then right eye, with the transition deleted.

Other people can see your eyes move because *their* visual systems aren't issuing the motor command that produces the suppression. They experience your eye movement as a normal visual event in the external world. From where they stand, nothing is being suppressed.

You are, in a precise sense, blind to your own eye movements.

## The Numbers Add Up to Something Unsettling

The average person makes roughly three to four saccades per second when reading or examining a scene. Each saccade lasts perhaps 50 to 150 milliseconds. Over a 16-hour waking day, this adds up to somewhere between 150,000 and 250,000 saccades.

The suppressed intervals accumulate to an estimated 40 minutes of blindness per day — sensory blackouts so brief and so thoroughly edited by the brain that they register as nothing.

Your subjective experience of seamless, continuous vision is a construction. The actual data stream from your eyes is discontinuous, fragmented, periodically blank. What you experience as the stable, persistent visual world is a model the brain maintains and updates in real time, papering over the gaps.

## What This Says About Perception

Saccadic suppression is one of the cleaner demonstrations of a general principle that vision science has established: what you see is not a direct feed from the eyes. It is a model maintained by the brain using the eyes as input — a model that the brain edits, predicts, smooths, and fills in according to its own processing requirements.

The brain suppresses information when it would be more disruptive than useful. It predicts the next frame before it arrives. It discards blurred data and substitutes expectations. It presents the result as seamless, stable reality.

This is not a bug. A perceptual system that faithfully transmitted every blurred saccadic streak would be unusable. The editing is functional.

But it means that what you experience as "just looking at the world" is already several layers of inference and prediction removed from the raw signal. The eyes don't see. The brain constructs a world, and vision is one of the tools it uses.

Go look in a mirror. Watch your eyes move.

You still won't see it. The machinery that prevents you from seeing it is the same machinery that makes everything else you see coherent and stable.

The price of a stable world is a blind spot in the one doing the looking.
