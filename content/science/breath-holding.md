You're underwater. Lungs burning. You think: *I'm running out of oxygen. Breathe.*

That thought is wrong.

What's actually burning is carbon dioxide — CO₂ building up in your blood, screaming at your brainstem to open your mouth. Your oxygen levels, at that moment, are probably fine.

This seems like a minor technical detail. It isn't. The difference between what you think is happening and what's actually happening has drowned competitive swimmers in their own pools.

## The Wrong Mental Model

Ask anyone why we need to breathe and they'll say: to get oxygen.

That's true in the big picture. But it's not what drives the moment-to-moment *urge* to breathe. Your body doesn't directly detect falling oxygen. It detects rising CO₂.

Here's the mechanism: as your cells burn fuel, they produce carbon dioxide. CO₂ dissolves into your blood, forms carbonic acid, and drops your blood's pH. Chemoreceptors — tiny pH sensors in your carotid arteries and brainstem — detect this acidification and send an emergency signal upward: *breathe now*.

This works beautifully under normal conditions. CO₂ builds as O₂ depletes. They track together. The CO₂ alarm is a reliable proxy.

The problem: it's *only* a proxy. And proxies can be gamed.

## What Happens When You Hyperventilate

Take 30 deep, fast breaths right now. Your chest fills with oxygen you don't need — but more importantly, you blast out carbon dioxide. Blood CO₂ drops dramatically. pH rises.

Now try to hold your breath.

You can go much longer than normal. The CO₂-driven urge barely appears. Your body thinks everything is fine.

It isn't. Oxygen has been falling the entire time. But with CO₂ artificially suppressed, you have no early warning system. No burning sensation. No diaphragm spasms. No sense that anything is wrong.

Until you lose consciousness.

This is **shallow water blackout**. And the victims are usually not drowning novices — they're experienced swimmers, competitive athletes, people trying to extend their breath-hold. They hyperventilate at the edge of the pool to "load up" on oxygen. They dive. They feel fine right up until they don't. Then they sink, limp, face-down.

The truly terrifying part: there's no alarm. One moment you're swimming. Then you're gone.

## The Numbers

Your normal blood oxygen saturation is around 98–99%. You pass out at roughly 50–60%. Somewhere between those thresholds, you feel nothing urgent — no light-headedness, no visual dimming — until you're already past the point of voluntary action.

Compare this to CO₂: even a modest rise in blood CO₂ (less than 10mmHg above normal) produces the unmistakable, uncomfortable urge to breathe. It's a hair-trigger.

Your body trusts CO₂ more than O₂ for good reason. Under normal metabolic conditions, they move in lockstep. Evolution never needed to build a better oxygen sensor because CO₂ was always a good enough alarm.

The lockstep assumption breaks down in two scenarios: hyperventilation, and high-altitude environments (where you can be severely hypoxic before CO₂ builds). Both have killed people who didn't understand the mechanism.

## The Wim Hof Connection

Wim Hof's breathing method involves rapid, deep cycles of hyperventilation followed by breath retention. Practitioners often report tingling, euphoria, altered states — and some pass out.

He knows this. He says it explicitly: *never do the breathing in water*. Several deaths have occurred from people doing Wim Hof breathing in the bathtub or pool. The method creates exactly the shallow water blackout precondition — just without the water, usually.

The altered states are real. The physiology behind them is straightforward: hyperventilation lowers CO₂, which constricts cerebral blood vessels (CO₂ is a vasodilator), which reduces brain blood flow, which causes the tingling, the light-headedness, the dissociation. You're mildly hypoxic and don't know it. It feels like something profound. It's your brain running out of fuel.

## What Actually Saves You (Normally)

In ordinary breath-holding, the CO₂ alarm *does* work. You get the burning. Then the diaphragm contractions — involuntary spasms that are your body's last attempt to force a breath. They become intolerable before your O₂ drops to dangerous levels.

This is why you can't casually hold your breath until you pass out at the edge of a pool. The CO₂ alarm wins. You breathe.

The only way to override it is to clear the CO₂ first. Which is what hyperventilation does. Which is why the warning has to be stated plainly:

**Never hyperventilate before swimming underwater. Not to go farther. Not to go deeper. Not to beat your own record. The only thing it does is disable the alarm that keeps you alive.**

## The Deeper Point

Your brain runs on proxies. Blood pressure, blood sugar, oxygen, temperature — almost none of these are monitored directly. They're inferred from related signals that are easier to measure, that historically tracked close enough.

Most of the time, the proxy is fine. Close enough to true.

But you are not most of the time. You're a specific person, with specific knowledge, in a specific situation. Sometimes knowing the mechanism lets you game it. Sometimes gaming it kills you.

The burning in your lungs is an alarm. Like any alarm, once you know how it works, you can disable it.

The question is whether you should.
