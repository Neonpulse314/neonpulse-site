Marcus read the job offer twice. Full-time position. Competitive salary. Dr. Chen's signature at the bottom.

He'd been waiting six months for this. He set the letter down and looked at his second monitor.

The photo was still there from the news story. Six workers in hard hats on the Tower Road scaffolding, taken the week before the section failed. They were laughing at something outside the frame. He didn't know any of their names.

Nobody had been hurt. That was the part he kept returning to. The scaffolding had failed at 6:40am on a Tuesday, forty minutes before the morning shift arrived. An equipment failure — unrelated to his calculation error — had pushed the timeline back. Forty minutes. If the crew had been on that section when the support buckled, the safety netting would have caught most of them. Probably.

Marcus had made the error in week two. He'd been running load calculations for a secondary support structure and transposed two numbers in a stress formula. Not a typo — he'd misread his own handwriting from two days prior. The kind of mistake that happened when you were working sixty-hour weeks and answering emails during lunch.

He'd caught it three days later. Fixed it in the model. Signed off on the corrected version without flagging the discrepancy. Told himself it was a minor internal correction, not a safety issue, not worth the paperwork or the conversation.

He had believed that. More or less.

The section that failed wasn't the section his calculation covered. That was the part that should have let him sleep. It didn't.

The offer letter sat on his desk for four days.

He ran the logic repeatedly. The error was fixed. The bridge was repaired. No documentation linked the original miscalculation to the failure — because they weren't linked, not directly, not provably. Coming forward now meant: losing the job, possible professional liability, a formal investigation. His name on a report. Maybe more.

He would be doing this entirely for himself. There was nothing left to correct. The bridge was safe. The crew was fine. Dr. Chen trusted him. The company needed engineers.

Every part of this was true.

On the fourth day, Marcus picked up the offer letter and walked to Dr. Chen's office.

He explained it in eight minutes. The original error, the self-correction, the decision not to document it, the failure, what he'd concluded about the relationship between the two. Dr. Chen listened without interrupting.

"Why are you telling me this now?" she said.

Marcus looked at the offer letter in his hand.

"Because you trusted me," he said. "And I don't want to take the job on a foundation that isn't there."

He was let go the following week. The company needed to demonstrate accountability to the project insurer. His error, while corrected and structurally unrelated to the failure, created documentation liability. HR was apologetic. Legal was not.

Dr. Chen found him in the parking lot on his last day.

"The investigation cleared you of the failure itself. The section that went down — your calculation had nothing to do with it."

"I know," Marcus said.

"Then why—"

"Because I would have known," he said. "Every project I worked on after this. I would have known."

She looked at him for a moment.

"For what it's worth — I would have hired you again."

He drove home with a box of desk things on the passenger seat. He sat in the parking lot of his apartment complex for a while, in the quiet, and thought about the six workers in the photograph.

He didn't know their names. He never would.

He had done this for himself — to be the kind of person who could look at work he signed his name to and trust what was behind it. That was a selfish reason. He wasn't sure it was the wrong one.

He slept better that night than he had in three months.
