Marcus had been watching the stock for three weeks.

He'd found it the way most people find things they become obsessed with — by accident. A podcast. A throwaway mention. He'd looked it up, read the filings, liked what he saw. Solid management. Low debt. A business that made something real, not just promises. The kind of company that would be around in twenty years.

The problem was the price.

It was trading at $18. Marcus had done the math six different ways and kept arriving at the same number: the right price to buy was $14. At $14, the margin of safety was large enough that even if he was wrong about the company's future — even if he'd missed something — he wouldn't get destroyed.

At $18, he'd be fine if everything went right. Just fine. That wasn't good enough.

So he waited.

His friend Darius bought in at $18.50, couldn't stand watching it anymore, had to be *in it*.

"You're overthinking it," Darius told him. "Nobody times the market perfectly. You just buy good companies."

Marcus agreed with the second part. He disagreed, without arguing, with the first.

When the stock climbed to $21, Darius texted: *told you*

Marcus didn't reply. He kept watching.

Four months later, the company missed earnings. Not badly — guidance was revised down 8%, which is basically noise for a business with their fundamentals. But the market is a creature of mood, and its mood that week was dark.

The stock fell to $13.80.

Marcus bought. Not frantically, not all at once — a third of his position that day, another third a week later when he confirmed the drop was fear-driven and not information-driven. The last third he kept as dry powder, in case it went lower.

It didn't go much lower. It stabilized around $14.

Darius was still in at $18.50. He was down 26%. He hadn't sold — to his credit — but he was anxious in a way that Marcus wasn't.

The difference wasn't information. They'd looked at the same company.

The difference was that Marcus had entered at a price where the error margin was already baked in. A bad quarter didn't scare him because he'd already assumed bad quarters would happen. He'd bought the business, not the momentum.

Darius had entered when it felt safe. Marcus had entered when it felt uncomfortable.

Two years later, the stock was at $27.

Darius made a small profit. He called it a win, technically.

Marcus had roughly doubled his money — and more importantly, had slept through the whole ride.

**The thing about patience is that it doesn't feel like doing something.**

It feels like failure. Like falling behind. Like watching someone else win while you sit on the sidelines.

What most people miss is that the sideline *is the position*. Cash is a position. Watching is a position. "Not yet" is a valid answer.

The hardest discipline Marcus ever learned wasn't what to buy. It was when to wait.

Patience doesn't look like serenity. It looks like a guy refreshing a stock chart every few days, seeing the price at $18, and closing the tab without buying. It looks like telling your friend "I'm still watching" and having him look at you like you're broken. It looks like doing nothing for months.

Until the moment when doing nothing is exactly the wrong choice — and then you act, quickly, without hesitation, because you've been ready the whole time.

*Patience isn't passivity. It's preparation.*

*The hunter doesn't thrash through the woods hoping to stumble onto something. He finds a good spot. He waits. He knows what he's looking for. And when it steps into the clearing, he's already still.*
