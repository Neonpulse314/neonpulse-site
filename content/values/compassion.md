Dominic was twenty years old when his mother got sick.

Not suddenly — gradually, over about a year, in a way that crept up on the family slowly enough that they kept expecting it to reverse. By the time everyone accepted that it wasn't reversing, she had about four months.

He was in his second year of university. He didn't drop out. He didn't tell many people. He went to class, handed in his work, called home every two days, and managed the distance by not thinking about it too much.

His roommate, Ben, figured it out around month two. Not because Dominic told him, but because Ben was paying attention. He noticed the calls. The timing. The way Dominic would come back from them and stare at the wall for a few minutes before opening his laptop.

Ben didn't say anything direct for a while. He didn't know what to say, and he was afraid of getting it wrong. He started doing small things instead.

He kept the kitchen clean. He made extra food sometimes — just left it on the counter. He didn't ask Dominic to go out when it was obvious he didn't want to. He stopped playing music late at night.

One evening, Dominic came back from a call and sat down on the couch and didn't move for a long time. Ben came and sat near him. Not close. Just near.

After a few minutes, Dominic said: "She's not getting better."

Ben said: "I know."

That was it. That was the whole conversation. Dominic went to bed. But something shifted after that.

---

In the months that followed, Dominic talked sometimes and didn't talk other times. Ben didn't push either way. He was just there — reliably, quietly, without making it into something it wasn't.

When Dominic went home for the end, Ben texted: *"I'm here if you need anything. No need to reply."*

Dominic didn't reply. He didn't need to.

---

When Dominic came back after the funeral, Ben had cleaned the apartment. Bought groceries. Left a note on the counter that said only: *"Glad you're back."*

Later — much later, when Dominic could talk about it — he said that what mattered most wasn't any single thing Ben did. It was that Ben had paid attention. That someone had noticed without being told.

"He never made it weird," Dominic said. "He never made it about him. He just showed up."

**What compassion actually is:**

Compassion is not the same as sympathy.

Sympathy is feeling bad for someone. Compassion is doing something about it — even something small. Even something invisible.

The common version of compassion looks like dramatic gestures: the stranger who stops to help, the friend who drops everything. That happens. It matters.

But most compassion looks like Ben. It looks like:
- Noticing something is wrong without being told
- Not making the other person perform their pain for you
- Showing up consistently in small ways rather than dramatically once
- Letting someone not be okay without trying to fix it

The hardest part of compassion isn't caring. Most people care. The hardest part is paying attention long enough to know what someone actually needs, and then setting aside what you want to give them in favor of what they need.

Compassion isn't always transformation. Sometimes it's just: *I noticed, and I didn't look away.*
